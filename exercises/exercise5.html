        <h2>Short Bio</h2>

        <p>I am graduating in May of 2025 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with my B.A. in English and a minor in education. Since the fall of 2024, I have been interning for the School of Earth and Sustainability (SES) at UMass, working on projects related to a climate science training that SES is developing. I am passionate about environmentalism and environmental justice. I am interested in pursuing a career related to those interests and in which I can continue developing my writing, communication, and research skills.</p>

        <h2>Longer Bio</h2>

        <h3>Academics and sustainability-focused experience</h3>

        <p>I am an undergraduate English major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, graduating in May 2025. I have developed close reading, writing, and researching skills in my English and education classes and other subject areas during my college career. Beginning in September of 2024, I have put these skills towards my work on climate literacy projects as an intern for the School of Earth and Sustainability (SES) at UMass.</p>
        <p>My work as an intern at SES has included collaborative projects with other undergraduate and graduate student interns. I worked with another undergraduate student on a detailed review and one-page summary of the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030, a hundred-page document created to guide policies and programs aimed at decarbonizing the state economy. We worked together to summarize all key background information, strategies, and technologies and focused our summary on what would be most relevant for the other SES team members working on climate science modules. We emphasized the ways in which higher education institutions like UMass and students could help advance decarbonization and climate change mitigation efforts.</p>
       
        <h3>Thesis project in English department</h3>
        <p>I am interested in how writing and literature can help us communicate and make sense of climate change and environmental justice issues and motivate people to push for change. I am currently working on my honors thesis project, for which I manage and pace my work by myself with the support of a faculty advisor. My thesis project involves analyzing works in ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, critical disability studies, and queer theory and using these theoretical frameworks to analyze two novels and a few short stories. Through this project, I am trying to explore questions about the impacts of environmental degradation on natural spaces and human bodies and minds.</p>
