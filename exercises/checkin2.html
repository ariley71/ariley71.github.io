        <h2>Columbidae family</h2>
        <p>Columbidae is a bird family consisting of doves and pigeons. Smaller species tend to be called “doves” and larger ones “pigeons”, although there is no scientific distinction between the two terms. The Columbidae family is divided into 353 species. Pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on earth, except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, and the high Arctic. The largest geographic range of an Columbidae species is that of the rock dove, also called the common pigeon.</p>

        <h2>Most Common Columbidae Species by Population</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mourning dove: 475 million</li>
            <li>Rock dove: 260 million</li>
