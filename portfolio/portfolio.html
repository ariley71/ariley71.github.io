                    <h2>Review of Massachusetts Climate Plan</h2>
                    <p>As a part of my internship for the UMass School of Earth Sciences and Sustainability (SES), I worked with another undergraduate student on a detailed review and one-page summary of the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030, a hundred-page document created to guide policies and programs aimed at decarbonizing the state economy. I worked to summarize and synthesize information from the climate plan and collaborated with the other student intern to ensure our documents were understandable and highlighted the most relevant information to SES.</p>

                    <p>I wrote a five-page literary analysis on the play M. Butterfly by David Henry Hhwang for my junior year writing class on spy fiction. Using Judith Butler’s framework of gender as a performance, I argued that gender is presented in the text as a performance that can be used to subvert existing power dynamics and shape others’ perceptions of reality.</p>

                    <h2>Writing and Schooling Ethnography Essay</h2>
                    <p>In an English class on Writing and Schooling I took in spring 2024, I wrote an ethnography-style essay based on notes I collected from observing a class session of freshman-year writing course at UMass and an interview I had previously conducted with the instructor. I considered how the instructor’s teaching approach and what I noticed observing their class related to theories in the study of writing about feedback giving and the teaching of writing.</p>

                    <h2>Honors Independent Study Essay on <i>Parable of the Sower</i></h2>
                    <p>In the spring of 2024 as a part of my studies in the Commonwealth Honors College, I completed a one-credit independent study on one of my favorite books, Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. I worked with a faculty advisor to write a literary analysis essay in which I analyzed how the main character’s experience of disability impacts how she navigates environmental and societal collapse. I supported my analysis with theoretical texts from critical disability studies and the environmental humanities.</p>
