                    <h2>Academics</h2>
                    <p>I graduated with a BA in English from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in May 2025, and also completed a minor in Education and letters of specialization in the Environmental Humanities and Literature as History. I have developed close reading, writing, and researching skills in my English courses and other subject areas during my college career. Since graduating, I am searching for job opportunities in which I can use my writing, editing, or communication skills to help advance sustainability efforts.</p> 

                    <h2>Experience and Interest in Sustainability</h2>
                    <p>In my role as a student intern at the UMass School of Earth and Sustainability (SES), I worked on collaborative projects with other undergraduate and graduate student interns. I worked with another undergraduate student on a detailed review and one-page summary of the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030, a hundred-page document created to guide policies and programs aimed at decarbonizing the state economy. We worked together to summarize all key background information, strategies, and technologies and focused our summary on what would be most relevant for the other SES team members working on climate science modules. We emphasized the ways in which higher education institutions like UMass and students could help advance decarbonization and climate change mitigation efforts.</p>
